# Roblox-Game-Scripts

> A Lua project


These scripts are the core code base behind the game Boss Battle in Roblox.
To utilize these scripts on your own, dowload Roblox Studio at https://www.roblox.com/Create.

This platform allows you to create your own roblox games and will provide an interface in which you may run these scripts.

As the project stands the game is in an Alpha release. Core functionality exists although minimal gameplay testing has taken place. This game was created for fun and learning purposes by my cousin and I.
